#### My motto in Life
>"A **meta condition**. Do it solely expecting to lose, and consciously focus on doing your best while being unconscious of winning."

>"**Learning** is a great foundation of success; you'll be able to project what you want to do in life. Here's the catch: *Learning* does not guarantee genuine long/short-term success; Your *goal* does not exist and will never exist in reality unless you keep building to bring that into the present. **You have to keep ***Building while Thinking.*****"

>"*What would you do if you were in a field of randomness, uncertainty, and incomplete information?* That is right. ***Welcome to Trading***, where you yourself must develop your own optimal way of trading that consistently generates profitable EV, despite learning valuable foundations from others."

>Mistakes are inevitable. You just need to create/build achievements that outweigh your flaws.
