    "Self taught and no mentor. But used countless freebies which exist across the internet. I've been strictly trading only XAUUSD in the Forex Exchange Market, in my manual retail trading career but still couldn't get consistent profitability. In fact I already lost 148k+ petot, but that data is worth roughly about 9 months in trading, even though I'm a trader with  18 months experience. My first 7 months (from June 7, 2024) were already at a six-figure loss. I stopped doing live trade but continued in demo accounts and a lot of backtests in my manual career. Never lost a day to practice trade. Despite that, I've made a lot of self made documentation 1500+ pages covering time & OCHL prices, volume volatility, market profiles, and orderflows mechanics (auction, footprint, heatmap & bubble orders, depth of the market) and some short books. I’ve developed a complex strategy and generated a clean upward equity curve in a live account. I’ve also coded indicators and strategies in TradingView, from simple to complex algorithms. But still not my ideal way of trading, it's too psychologically draining to implement. And I don't imagine myself watching the screen until I die (literal death). Recently, early November 2025, I've switched into becoming a fully systematic and automated trader, no discretionary decision involved in trading. I find it not hard to adapt from topics like prompting, coding, programing, large language models, machine learning, neural network, artificial intelligence, and many more embedded in algorithmic trading. Why and how? Because I like Research. I've read numerous academic papers but still haven't found an ideal way to trade the XAUUSD market. Perhaps, they haven't covered my way of trading. As if im doing a useless hobby of mine again like watching numerous trading videos on youtube but now I'm reading papers, their thoughts aren't new to me and it's not significant to what im trying to build (even though I searched using keywords). Perhaps, the wild cards aren't published on the internet? I don't know, at least I'll try reading 10k+ books? make a bet. Long story short, everything found on the internet almost went straight to be called ‘trash’ in the XAUUSD market once again, at least at this time. It's not that their ideas are bad, it's just that they are not applicable in the said pair. I’ve also made fully automated trading strategies from backtesting, demo forward testing, and live trading. I’ve made 5 research papers about the development of algorithmic strategies, non-copied ideas.\n",
