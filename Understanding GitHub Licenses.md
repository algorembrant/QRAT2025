# Understanding GitHub Licenses

A **GitHub license** defines what other people are allowed (or not allowed) to do with your code.  
If you upload a project to GitHub **without a license**, the default is **copyrighted**—meaning no one can legally use your code without your permission.

## 🔍 Why Licenses Matter

A license provides clear rules for:
- How others can use your code  
- Whether they can modify or distribute it  
- Whether they must credit you  
- Whether they can use your work commercially  

Without a license, **others cannot:**
- Copy your code  
- Modify your code  
- Use it in their projects  
- Distribute it

## 📝 What a License Covers

Licenses typically specify:
- Personal or commercial usage rights  
- Requirements to give attribution  
- Whether modified versions must also be open-source  
- Liability and warranty disclaimers
