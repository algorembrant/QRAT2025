Do not enter the trade if the initial-stoploss distance is less than the (corresponding symbol's spread x 10) distance. Risking 1% on the trade, accounting for the full stop-loss distance. The take-profit will depend on the stop-loss trailing mechanism. The stoploss will only trail at every preceding 'bullish H3 candle's low, skipping the bearish H3 candles.
