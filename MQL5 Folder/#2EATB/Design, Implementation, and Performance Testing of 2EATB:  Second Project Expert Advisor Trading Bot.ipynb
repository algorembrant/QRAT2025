    "The spread is the difference between the ask price (buy price) and the bid price (sell price) that a broker quotes for a currency pair or asset. It is essentially an instant cost built into the market price. Spreads can be fixed (always the same) or variable (changing with market volatility). You pay the spread immediately when entering a trade because it is part of the market execution and does not require a separate fee.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Commission**\n",
    "\n",
    "A commission is a separate fee charged by the broker for executing a trade. It is usually calculated as a percentage of trade size, a fixed amount per lot, or sometimes as a percentage of profit or loss in backtests. Unlike spread, commission does not affect the entry price; instead, it is added to or subtracted from your account balance independently. Some brokers offer zero-spread accounts but compensate by charging commissions."
