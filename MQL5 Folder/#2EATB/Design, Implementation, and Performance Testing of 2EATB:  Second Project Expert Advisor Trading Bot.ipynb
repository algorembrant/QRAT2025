    "**Why Exness**\n",
    "Exness is preferred for algorithmic trading because it fully supports Expert Advisors (EAs) on MT4 and MT5, allowing automated strategies on live accounts with withdrawals handled like regular trades. Its Cent accounts let traders test strategies with minimal risk, and third-party EAs are explicitly permitted, offering flexibility for both beginners and experienced traders (Exness Service, n.d.).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is widely used in algorithmic trading for backtesting because it is easy to learn, supports rapid prototyping, and offers powerful libraries such as pandas, NumPy, TA-Lib, and backtrader for fast data manipulation, analysis, and strategy development. It also integrates seamlessly with APIs for historical data and broker execution. For this study, Python 3.13 was used because MT5 currently only supports Python versions up to 3.13.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why MT5**\n",
    "\n",
    "MetaTrader 5 (MT5) is preferred for backtesting because it provides reliable historical price data and connects directly with Python via the MT5-Python API. This allows traders to fetch and analyze data, test automated strategies, and implement complex analyses using Python, while MT5 handles execution and order placement. The combination enables efficient backtesting and a smooth transition to live trading (Documentation on MQL5: Python Integration, n.d.).\n",
    ".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spread**\n",
    "\n",
    "The spread is the difference between the ask price (buy price) and the bid price (sell price) that a broker quotes for a currency pair or asset. It is essentially an instant cost built into the market price. Spreads can be fixed (always the same) or variable (changing with market volatility). You pay the spread immediately when entering a trade because it is part of the market execution and does not require a separate fee.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Commission**\n",
    "\n",
    "A commission is a separate fee charged by the broker for executing a trade. It is usually calculated as a percentage of trade size, a fixed amount per lot, or sometimes as a percentage of profit or loss in backtests. Unlike spread, commission does not affect the entry price; instead, it is added to or subtracted from your account balance independently. Some brokers offer zero-spread accounts but compensate by charging commissions."
