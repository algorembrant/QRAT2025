    "Spread vs. Commissio Spread The spread is the difference between the ask price (buy price) and the bid price (sell price) that a broker quotes for a currency pair or asset. It’s essentially an instant “cost” built into the market price.Spreads can be fixed (same always) or variable (changes with market volatility). You pay the spread immediately when entering a trade; it is part of the market execution and does not require a separate fee. Commission\n",
    "Commission is a separate fee charged by the broker for executing a trade.It is usually calculated as a percentage of trade size, a fixed amount per lot, or sometimes as a percentage of profits/losses in backtests.Unlike spread, commission does not affect the entry price; it is added/subtracted from your account balance separately. Some brokers offer zero-spread accounts, but they compensate by charging commissions.\n",
    "Summary Spread is an embedded cost in the price you pay immediately when entering a trade. Commission is a separate fee applied to trade size or PnL, affecting net profit/loss directly.Some brokers use only spread, some only commission, and some both, which changes the effective cost of trading and your break-even point.\n",
