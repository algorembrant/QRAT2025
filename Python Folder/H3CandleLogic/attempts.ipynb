    "Do not delete anything from the code, just add a logic where {Conduct a backtest (use realistic trade executions similar in live environment): If the pattern is bullish, then buy at the close,e and the stoploss is at the low of the corresponding candle. If the pattern is bearish, then sell at the close, and the stoploss is at the high of the corresponding candle. The take-profit distance varies depending on the trailing mechanics. If bullish entry, then only trail the stoploss if the preceding candles are bullish and place the trail at the low of the bullish candle. If bearish entry, then only trail the stoploss if the preceding candles are bearish and place the trail at the high of the bearish candle. 1% risk per trade with an initial capital of 1000. And: (Random slippage of 0-2 price units, spread of 0.60 price units (0.60 in entry, 0.60 in exit), and commission of 2% per trade. All of these apply in individual entries and exits) Print the dataframe for raw trades results, covering risked money (from percent), entry and exit time, stoploss and takeprofit distance, entry and exit prices and types, slippage, spread, commission cost, net pnl, equity, and many more. All trades are only valid within their corresponding trading day from pre-market open to overnight close. Print the data frame in a continuous column manner. Use a green breakline if entry to take profit, and a red breakline if entry to stoploss. On the chart. } Be careful and reread the task,"
